# Readables
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Readables is my final project for section 3 of the Udacity React Nanodegree program. Readables uses react and redux for state management.  Readables is a forum app which allows people to post topics and have people comment on their topic. Each topic has the ability to be up voted or down voted.  The posts are atomically sort based on most votes. Each post can be clicked on which takes you to a details page where you will see the comments and have the ability to edit and delete the post. Each comment also has the ability to up and down vote and edit and delete.

The backend API was provided by Udacity.  I was responsible for the font end code. functionally of each piece of the ui and the design.
